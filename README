Kibana - A web based log analysis tool
Copyright 2011 Rashid Khan <flipwork #logstash irc.freenode.net>

Installation
------------
This assumes you already have a functioning logstash/elasticsearch
infrastructure, perhaps with some filters to define fields. Config
of logstash and/or elasticsearch is outside of the scope of this file

Other than that, it works just like any other PHP application. Untar 
and go at it. 

Edit config.php to set your elasticsearch server. 

Notes
-----
Q: Why is there no last button?
A: ElasticSearch isn't so hot at going to the last result of a many
million result query. 

Q: Why is everything broken?
A: Because this is wildly alpha

Q: Why is this in PHP instead of Java, Ruby, etc?
A: Because PHP is what I know. The total PHP is less than 200 lines.
If you want it in something else, it shouldn't be too hard to port 
the backend to your language of choice
